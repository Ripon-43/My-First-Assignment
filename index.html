                    <small>Everybody needs food to eat. Some people enjoy eating in a restaurant, and some people enjoy making their own meals at home. There are many kinds of food that we can buy, so we can taste the different styles we want, and try foods from different countries. In America, it is very easy for us to find special food to eat because people from many different countries have opened their style restaurant. If we have enough money to spend we can eat many, many, kinds of meals.</small>
